# Requirements

In order to build on Windows the following tools should be installed:

  - Visual Studio. For a minimal install, the command line only build tools can be
    downloaded and installed from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017

  - Cmake

  - (optional) The OpenSSL library. Prebuild binaries can be downloaded from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html .
    The full version is required (not the "Light" version).

    IMPORTANT: in order to skip OpenSSL compilation, edit CMakeLists.txt and replace
      OPTION(N2N_OPTION_AES "USE AES" ON)
    with
      OPTION(N2N_OPTION_AES "USE AES" OFF)

In order to run n2n:

  - The TAP drivers should be installed into the system. They can be installed from
    http://build.openvpn.net/downloads/releases (search for "tap-windows")

  - If OpenSSL has been compiled, the corresponding .dll file should be available
    into the target computer

# Build (CLI)

In order to build from the command line, open a terminal window and run the following commands:

```
md build
cd build
cmake ..

MSBuild edge.vcxproj /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release
MSBuild supernode.vcxproj /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release
```

The compiled exe files should now be available under the Release directory.
